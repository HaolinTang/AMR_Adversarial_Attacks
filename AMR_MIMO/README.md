# AMR-Dataset-for-MIMO-system-with-precoding



# Dataset Description
The dataset is generated by MATLAB and then Keras with Tensorflow as the backend is used to train the modulation recognition model. The data are modulated using different modulation methods, including ‘2PSK‘, ‘QPSK‘, ‘8PSK‘,
‘16QAM‘, ‘64QAM‘, and ‘128QAM‘. The number of transmitted symbols per sample is 128, and we prepare 500 samples per SNR per scheme, which are divided into three parts for training, validation, and testing by the ratio of 6:2:2.
