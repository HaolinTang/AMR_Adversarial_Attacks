# AMR_Adversarial_Attacks
This is a repository includes the source codes of paper "Security Concerns of Adversarial Attacks in Machine Learning Based Automatic Modulation Recognition Models for Next Generation Networks". 

## Installation & Usage
* **Run AMR for SISO Dataset:**
1. Download the SISO dataset (See [RML2016.10a](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/md1b7n1xibyf500sdt8nq/h?dl=0&rlkey=y2b7ph8aozkyci7xgb3lv2z7t)) and save it under AMR_SISO folder. RML2016.10a has been used in most research as a benchmark dataset. It contains 1.2 million signal samples and each sample is associated with one specific modulation (11 modulations in total) at a particular Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR). Each sample input is a vector of size 256, which corresponds to 128 in-phase and 128 quadrature components.
